# Research

Automatic Image caption generation is the process of generating textual description of an image. It uses both Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision to generate the captions. Given a input image the model generates a natural language description of the image. To generate the description the model use Computer vision to understand the image and later with the help of Natural Language Processing generates semantically and syntactically correct descriptions. My research goal is to generate captions in low resource Assamese language. I am also interested in other topics like visual question answering, face detection etc.
